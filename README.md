# Climate Policy Radar Open Data

This repo contains helpers for our open data, which you can find on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ClimatePolicyRadar/all-document-text-data).

## Getting started

The best place to get started is the [loading data notebook](./src/notebooks//1-loading-data.ipynb) at `src/notebooks`.

Other examples of notebooks and streamlit demos using this open data are in the `src` directory. Feel free to raise an issue if you'd like to add or propose an interesting use case for this data.
